# Model Card

For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
This is a Project for MLOps Udacity Nanodegree, Random Forest Classifier was used in order to classify 
Census Income Data Set.

## Intended Use
Thi is a learning project, we don't intend to use it in real life

## Training Data
WE use 80\% of the data [Census Income Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income) to train our model.

## Evaluation Data
The remining 20/% of the data used in the evaluation

## Metrics
- Precision: 0.740990990990991
- recall: 0.6294642857142857
- fbeta: 0.6806896551724138
## Ethical Considerations
The data is publicaly avilable
## Caveats and Recommendations
- More data needed from outside USA
- different classifier to be applied in order to enhance the decision.
